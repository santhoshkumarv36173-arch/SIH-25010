## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<h3>Agri app</h3>
<ul><li>

The proposed solution is a multilingual, AI-powered mobile application designed specifically for small and marginal farmers. The app provides personalized crop advisory by analyzing user-input data such as soil type, crop history, and location. It integrates real-time weather updates, soil health recommendations, and fertilizer guidance to help farmers make informed decisions. The app features pest and disease detection using image uploads, market price tracking, and voice support for users with low literacy. By delivering information in local languages and a user-friendly interface, the solution ensures accessibility and relevance. Continuous feedback and usage data collection enable ongoing improvement and adaptation to farmers’ needs.</li>
<li>

The solution directly tackles the challenges faced by small and marginal farmers by providing personalized, real-time advisory services tailored to their specific needs. By leveraging AI and multilingual support, the app overcomes language barriers and low digital literacy, making advanced agricultural guidance accessible to all. Features like soil health analysis, weather alerts, and pest detection help farmers make informed decisions, reducing reliance on guesswork and minimizing input costs and environmental impact. The user-friendly interface and voice support ensure that even farmers with limited technical skills can benefit from modern agri-tech resources.</li>
<li>Innovation and uniqueness of the solution</li></ul>

## Technical Approach
<h3>Technical Approach</h3>
<ul><li>## Technologies to be Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python (for AI/ML models), JavaScript/TypeScript (for frontend and backend), Java/Kotlin (for Android app), Swift (for iOS app)
- **Frameworks:** React Native or Flutter (for cross-platform mobile development), Django or Node.js (for backend/API)
- **AI/ML Libraries:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn (for advisory, image recognition, and predictive analytics)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Firebase (for user data and app storage)
- **Cloud Services:** AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure (for hosting, storage, and AI model deployment)
- **APIs:** Weather API (for real-time weather updates), Market price API (for crop price tracking)
- **Hardware (optional):** Smartphones (for app usage), IoT sensors (for soil and weather data collection)
- **Other Tools:** Google Translate API or similar (for multilingual support), Speech-to-text and text-to-speech libraries (for voice features)
</li>
<li>Methodology and process for implementation

1. **Requirement Analysis:** Gather detailed requirements from stakeholders, including farmers, extension officers, and agri-tech experts.
2. **Design:** Create wireframes and flowcharts for the mobile app, backend architecture, and AI model workflows.
3. **Development:**
   - Build the mobile app using React Native or Flutter.
   - Develop backend APIs with Django or Node.js.
   - Train AI/ML models for crop advisory, pest detection, and predictive analytics using Python libraries.
   - Integrate third-party APIs for weather and market prices.
   - Implement multilingual and voice support features.
4. **Testing:** Conduct unit, integration, and user acceptance testing with real farmers to ensure usability and accuracy.
5. **Deployment:** Host the app and backend on cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure). Release on app stores.
6. **Feedback & Iteration:** Collect user feedback and usage data for continuous improvement and feature updates.
7. **Scaling:** Expand to more regions, languages, and add IoT sensor integration for advanced data <b></b></li></ul>
